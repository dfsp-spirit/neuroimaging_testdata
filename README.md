# neuroimaging_testdata
Contains test data for unit tests, used in developing neuroimaging software. Ignore this. Licenses in the individual archives.

## About
This repo contains output files from Neuroimaging software that I use for unit tests. The data is usually large and may have a license that differs from that of the tested software, so I do not want to distribute it in the software repo. Instead, I download it from this github repo in a shell script before running the tests.

## Downloading
Remember to `wget` from *github.com/user/repo/**raw**/branch/path/to/file*, not from *.../repo/**blob**/branch/...*, as the latter will give you the HTML page instead.

## License
Carefully read the LICENSE files in the individual directories and/or archives before using the data.
